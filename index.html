                        <p>Till 2k20,
                            we were quite enjoying our lives to the fullest,<br>Using our resources(Oh! sorry, I mean
                            earth's resources)as we wanted.<br> but then, Something happened, something strange.....but
                            what?
                            nobody knew.<br> It was December 2k19 when the world witnessed a state of fear<br> when
                            china reported some cases of this virus in its some parts {mainly Wuhan}. <br>but we
                            humans(tho we are considered the smartest}, still didn't take any action .<br>Then in early
                            2k20,
                            came the first case in India from a person coming from Italy<br>(here the trouble
                            began).<br>A series of problems, implementation of lockdown, came to existence,<br>ended up
                            trapping people in their residence.<br>
                            Fear, Deaths were on a streak on breaking records(records of Virat Kohli?)<br>.colleges
                            , schools
                            , offices went shut shifting their working to online mode.<br>
                            exams got postponed(mine too, but it didn't matter anything to me).<br>everything went
                            upside-down<br>Then, later that year things started getting under control...<br>In march
                            2k21, it all started again but quite more deadly than the previous one<br>shortage of
                            ventilators,200k+ cases every day[THE SECOND WAVE WAS HERE]<br></p>

                            in a span of 1yr.....<br>Coming back to the topic..<br> we have been destroying earth's
                            atmosphere and balance since ages. <br>Unmoniterd cunsumption of petroleum, cutting down
                            forests,
                            poaching,etc-etc.These all human activities have been affecting earth atmosphere, damaging
                            the
                            nature cycle.<br>but now nature is returning all the favours we humans have done ,locking us
                            inside our homes, killing us as we used to kill animals for pleasure and skin and tooth,
                            damaging our lifestyles as we damaged earth's lifestyle.<br>but the best part is , NATURE IS
                            HEALING ITSELF...but again the question is till when??<br>Once we humans are done dealing
                            with
                            the pandemic ,we will again come back to our so called normal lifestyle and the damaging
                            cycle will again resume.<br>then what did we learnt from this past 2 yrs of pandemic.?
                            <br>NOTHING!<br>

                        of 2020. Not only did engagement skyrocket as consumers stayed at home, but the industry pivoted
                        to ensure it was doing everything it could to keep consumers engaged. Branded crossover events,
                        virtual concerts and celebrity influencer participations all fueled a groundswell that shows no
                        signs of recedingâ€”even as the COVID-19 vaccine promises to allow people to once again be with
